* Introduction

A collection of blog posts about clojure and clojurescript. The
entries are written in org mode that allow for literate programming,
but can just be read fine without emacs and org mode. github itself
renders org documents just fine.

** Setting up a full stack clj / cljs project from scratch

[[./setting-up-clj-cljs-project-from-scratch.org][setting-up-clj-cljs-project-from-scratch.org]] describes in detail how
to setup a leiningen project with a ring/jetty backend server that
uses reitit for routing, and combining that project with a shadow-cljs
clojurescript SPA (Single Page Application) that uses reagent. The
result is a minimal full stack example in which it is possible to
switch between connected clojure and a clojurescript repls on the fly.

*** TODO Describe ajax calls

*** TODO Describe hosting minimally by showing how to produce a jar and a docker container

- [ ] Not necessary to include how to host in the cloud or on-premise
  for public access premise.

*** TODO Describe key-handler function by having index.html to be a hiccup template

** Namespaced keyword inheritance & Multimethods

[[./clj-derived-keywords-multimethods.org][clj-derived-keywords-multimethods.org]] shows a lesser known feature of
clojure that allows for on the fly creation of taxonomies by deriving
namespaced keywords from each other. These taxonomies can be useful
when using multimethods, as they will influence the resolved concrete
function to choose when dispatching on values containing namespaced
keywords.
